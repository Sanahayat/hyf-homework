Cinnamon pancakes with compote & maple syrup

INGREDIENTS:

140g self-raising flour
1 tsp ground cinnamon
3 tbsp muscovado sugar or brown sugar
1 large egg
300ml milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp melted butter
plus extra for frying
½ quantity apple, pear & cherry compote, to serve (see 'Goes well with')

METHOD:

First make the Apple, pear & cherry compote (see 'Goes well with'). You'll need half the compote for this recipe.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, sugar and ½ tsp salt. In a jug, whisk the egg, milk, vanilla and melted butter. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the milk mixture gradually, whisking as you go to make a smooth batter. Ideally, let the mixture stand for 1 hr (or even overnight, covered in the fridge), although you can cook with it straight away.

Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Melt a knob of butter, then drop in tbsps of the mixture to make pancakes about 10cm across. Cook for 2-3 mins until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip over and cook for 1 min more. Keep each batch warm while you use up the rest of the batter. Stack up the pancakes and serve with hot or cold compote, maple syrup and yogurt.
